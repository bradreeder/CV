### Anna Freud Centre

I facilitated hackathons, design sprints, usability testing, and training workshops on agile and design thinking methodologies for the Anna Freud Centre - a charity that provides support & training for child mental health services.

As a part of this, I scrum-mastered the agile process for their products **Grow** ([Website](https://growgoals.co.uk/login) | [Source Code](https://github.com/CYPIAPT-LNDSE/goals-app)) and **Getting to Know You** ([Website](https://welcome-in.herokuapp.com/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/CYPIAPT-LNDSE/welcome-to-camhs)) and developed their product Breathe With Me.

### Breathe With Me ([Website](https://breathewithme.co.uk/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/CYPIAPT-LNDSE/Breathe-With-Me))

I worked in a small team building a progressive web application aimed at young people with generalised anxiety disorders. The app improves resilience from stress by guiding the user through breathing and relaxation techniques, demonstrated using SVG and Greensock.js animations. The app is offline-first, accessible, responsive across devices, and supported across browsers. It is architected using a custom View-Controller Design Pattern.

The app originated from a design sprint we facilitated and we regularly usability tested it with young people in services throughout each build sprint.

**Tech Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, SVG, Javasript (ES6), Greensock.js, Service Workers (PWA), App Cache, Web Pack

### Tile Game ([Website](https://evening-reef-36937.herokuapp.com/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/bradreeder/Tile-game))

A recreation of some of the puzzles from the popular video game franchise [The Legend of Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda). Used to learn TDD (with Tape & TravisCI) and the Module design pattern.

Use the directional arrows on your keyboard to play and enter to refresh the game. The aim is to traverse every purple tile on the board without stepping on the same tile twice. There are multiple levels that increase in difficulty.

**Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (ES5), Node.js, Tape, TravisCI, Istanbul, CodeCov, Heroku

*Note: The following projects were built in 2-3 days, as learning exercises to implement studied technologies, and not with the intent of building commercial products. These projects were built in teams of 2 or 4 people (using pair programming), and so include other people's work.*

### Autocomplete ([Website](https://mighty-refuge-83559.herokuapp.com/public/origami.html) | [Source Code](https://github.com/FloatingIntegers/autocomplete-app))

An autocomplete application that returns the closest 10 word matches of a string entered into a form input field and updates as you type. The origami animations are implemented using a css library called [OriDomi](http://oridomi.com/).
