### Anna Freud Centre

I facilitated hackathons, design sprints, usability testing, and training workshops on agile and design thinking methodologies for the Anna Freud Centre - a charity that provides support & training for child mental health services.

As a part of this, I scrum-mastered the agile process for their products **Grow** ([Website](https://growgoals.co.uk/login) | [Source Code](https://github.com/CYPIAPT-LNDSE/goals-app)) and **Getting to Know You** ([Website](https://welcome-in.herokuapp.com/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/CYPIAPT-LNDSE/welcome-to-camhs)) and developed their product Breathe With Me.

### Breathe With Me ([Website](https://breathewithme.co.uk/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/CYPIAPT-LNDSE/Breathe-With-Me))

I worked in a small team building a progressive web application aimed at young people with generalised anxiety disorders. The app improves resilience from stress by guiding the user through breathing and relaxation techniques, demonstrated using SVG and Greensock.js animations. The app is offline-first, accessible, responsive across devices, and supported across browsers. It is architected using a custom View-Controller Design Pattern.

The app originated from a design sprint we facilitated and we regularly usability tested it with young people in services throughout each build sprint.

**Tech Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, SVG, Javasript (ES6), Greensock.js, Service Workers (PWA), App Cache, Web Pack
