I am a UX Researcher with multidisciplinary experience across web development, user research, facilitation, and teaching. Currently I freelance as a member of [Founders & Coders C.I.C](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a highly-selective web development school. I value continuous learning, collaborative working, and user-centred environments, and aspire to explore all aspects of UX and service design with likeminded people.

## EXPERIENCE

### Outlandish
#### UX Researcher
##### Jun 2017 - Sep 2017

I worked as a contractor for [Outlandish](https://outlandish.com/) as a UX Researcher. My brief was to research application ideas for, and diagnose the growth potential of, a young network of digital co-operatives called the [Cooperative Technologists](https://www.coops.tech/).

- I showed initiative in preparing and conducting my own research plan to meet the needs of the brief utilising secondary research, observation, interviewing, surveying, and usability testing methods.
- I demonstrated strong mediation, empathy, and synthesis skills in identifying and fairly representing key needs and problem areas in the network from data across 25 different organisations.
- I [reported my findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6NEu8lrcT7F0OhfSErQJImlAqA9ekJf8YoPzi20FV8/edit) at the planning meeting for the network's Annual General Meeting. My recommendations were well received and I have since been invited to have a speaking slot at the AGM in November.

### Founders & Coders
#### Course Facilitator
##### Nov 2016 - Jun 2017

I took on a community leadership role overseeing the curriculum for the [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/) web development campus in London. My responsibilities and accomplishments include:

- I co-authored, maintained, and was a main contributor to, the community's open-source [master resource.](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference) It is now its most popular resource and has been used to build campuses in Nazareth & Gaza.
- I steered the organisation towards a user-centred, validated learning approach to updating its curriculum. This included iteratively facilitating curriculum planning, in collaboration with staff, mentors, and students.
- Facilitating weekly agile ceremonies with students & mentors, including standups, retrospectives and demos.
- Supporting mentors & providing pastoral care for students.
- I worked with mentors and staff to re-design the second half of the programme. As a part of this, I co-created and ran a UX Design Sprint week - taking students through design thinking, user research, ideation, rapid prototyping, and usability testing - with the resident designers that can be found [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint).

#### Full Stack Javascript Developer

- I have facilitated the Anna Freud Centre's regular hackathons, run training workshops on design thinking, and acted as scrum-master for their MVPs. Responsibilities included managing communications with the product owners, guiding them through usability testing, and ensuring agile practices were followed.
