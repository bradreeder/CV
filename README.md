I am a **front-end developer** and **UX Professional** with multidisciplinary experience and training. I value continuous learning, collaborative working, and user-centred environments and am eager to explore new technologies with likeminded people. I am interested in using technology to empower people to lead happier, healthier, and safer lives.
