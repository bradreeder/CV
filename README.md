### EXPERIENCE

#### UX Researcher
##### Jun 2017 - Present

I worked independently for the digital agency [Outlandish](https://outlandish.com/) as a UX Researcher. My brief was to diagnose the growth potential, collect feedback on application ideas, and map the relationships and skills of a young network of digital co-operatives called the [Cooperative Technologists](https://www.coops.tech/). The role involved:

- Showing initiative in defining and conducting my own research plan utilising secondary research, shadowing & observation, interviewing, surveying, and user-testing methods.
- Demonstrating strong diplomacy, synthesis, and empathy skills in identifying and fairly representing key needs and problem areas in the network from data across 25 different organisations.
- Reporting my findings with recommended solutions and presenting it at the planning meeting for the network's Annual General Meeting. My recommendations were well received and I have since been invited to have a speaking slot at their AGM in November.

#### Course Facilitator
##### Nov 2016 - Jun 2017

I took on a leadership role overseeing the curriculum for the Founders & Coders web development bootcamp in London. My responsibilities included:

- Analysing our model & implementing key reforms.
- Iteratively improving the curriculum negotiating the feedback of students, mentors, and alumni.
- Facilitating curriculum planning & weekly agile ceremonies, including retrospectives and project demos.
- Facilitating our mentors & providing pastoral care to our students.
- Maintaining & creating teaching resources. An example of a UX-focused week - taking students through design thinking, user research, prototyping, and user-testing - I co-created with our resident designer can be found [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint).

I'm proud to have had a lasting impact on the programme by co-authoring the organisation's open-source [master resource](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference), and through collaboratively designing the structure of the curriculum, its materials, activities and processes from a user-centred perspective.
