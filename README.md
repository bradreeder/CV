# Bradley Reeder - UX Researcher

I am a natural empath and independent learner with experience across web development, user research, facilitation, teaching and collaborative environments. Currently I freelance and study as a member of [Founders & Coders C.I.C](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a highly-selective sixteen week web development school. My current motivations are to explore all aspects of user-centred and UX design in service of solving real world problems.

## EXPERIENCE

### Designlab
#### UX Research & Strategy Course
##### Oct 2017 - Nov 2017

I completed a programme on UX Research & Strategy, alongside IDEO's Human Centred Design course online, as a means of deepening my understanding of the Design Thinking methodology, and to expand my UX Research toolkit of methods, techniques and concepts.

### Outlandish
#### UX Researcher
##### Jun 2017 - Sep 2017

I worked as an independent contractor for the digital agency [Outlandish](https://outlandish.com/) as a UX Researcher. My brief was to collect feedback on application ideas, diagnose the growth potential, and map the relationships and skills of a young network of digital co-operatives called the [Cooperative Technologists](https://www.coops.tech/). The role involved:

- Showing initiative in defining and conducting my own research plan utilising secondary research, observation, interviewing, surveying, and user-testing methods.
- Demonstrating strong mediation, empathy, and synthesis skills in identifying and fairly representing key needs and problem areas in the network from data across 25 different organisations.
- [Reporting my findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6NEu8lrcT7F0OhfSErQJImlAqA9ekJf8YoPzi20FV8/edit) with recommended solutions and presenting it at the planning meeting for the network's Annual General Meeting. My recommendations were well received and I have since been invited to have a speaking slot at their AGM in November.

### Founders & Coders
#### Course Facilitator
##### Nov 2016 - Jun 2017

I took on a leadership role overseeing the curriculum for the [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/) web development bootcamp in London. My responsibilities included:

- Analysing its model & implementing key reforms. Of note, I co-authored and am a main contributor to the organisation's open-source [master resource](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference) which has since been used to open schools in Nazareth & Gaza.
- Iteratively improving the curriculum negotiating the feedback of, and in collaboration with, students, alumni, and staff.
- Facilitating curriculum planning & weekly agile ceremonies, including retrospectives and project demos.
- Supporting mentors & providing pastoral care to students.
- Maintaining & creating teaching resources. Of note, I created and facilitated a UX-focused week - taking students through design thinking, user research, ideation, prototyping, and user-testing - with the resident designer that can be found [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint).
