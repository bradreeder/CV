# Bradley Reeder - UX Researcher

I am a UX Researcher with multidisciplinary experience across web development, user research, facilitation, and teaching. Currently I freelance as a member of [Founders & Coders C.I.C](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a highly-selective web development school. I am a systems-thinker with a strong interest in service design and community building. I value continuous learning, collaborative working, and user-centred environments, and aspire to explore all aspects of UX design with likeminded people.

## EXPERIENCE

### Outlandish
#### UX Researcher
##### Jun 2017 - Sep 2017

I worked as an independent contractor for the digital agency [Outlandish](https://outlandish.com/) as a UX Researcher. My brief was to collect feedback on application ideas, diagnose the growth potential, and map the relationships and skills of a young network of digital co-operatives called the [Cooperative Technologists](https://www.coops.tech/). The role involved:

- Showing initiative in defining and conducting my own research plan utilising secondary research, observation, interviewing, surveying, and usability testing methods.
- Demonstrating strong mediation, empathy, and synthesis skills in identifying and fairly representing key needs and problem areas in the network from data across 25 different organisations.
- [Reporting my findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6NEu8lrcT7F0OhfSErQJImlAqA9ekJf8YoPzi20FV8/edit) with recommended solutions and presenting it at the planning meeting for the network's Annual General Meeting. My recommendations were accommodated into the AGM and I have since been invited to have a speaking slot at it in November.

### Founders & Coders
#### Course Facilitator
##### Nov 2016 - Jun 2017

I took on a community leadership role overseeing the curriculum for the [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/) web development campus in London. My responsibilities and accomplishments include:

- I co-authored, maintainined, and was a main contributor to, the organisation's open-source [master resource.](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference) It is now its most popular resource and has been used to build campuses in Nazareth & Gaza.
- I steered the organisation towards an evidence-based, validated learning approach to updating its curriculum. This included iteratively facilitating curriculum planning, negotiating the feedback of, and in collaboration with, students, mentors, and staff.
- Facilitating weekly agile ceremonies with students & mentors, including standups, retrospectives and demos.
- Supporting mentors & providing pastoral care for students.
- I worked with mentors and staff to re-design the second half of the programme. As a part of this, I co-created and facilitated a UX Design Sprint week - taking students through design thinking, user research, ideation, rapid prototyping, and usability testing - with the resident designers that can be found [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint).

Responsibilities included managing communications with the product owners, guiding them through usability testing, and ensuring agile (scrum) practices were followed.

## SKILLS

I am a natural empath, mediator, and listener. This has enabled me to find root problems in systems and experiences, understand the needs of multiple stakeholders, and effectively collaborate to identify strategies that address them. 

My core skillset is immersive research, a continuous learning mindset, and strong communication & presentation skills. I have experience working with the following technologies and am quick to pick up new tools and software:
